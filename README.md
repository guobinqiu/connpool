TCP Connection Pool

`Generated by ChatGPT`

Based on the code you provided, it seems like you are implementing a TCP connection pool in Go. The TcpConnPool struct represents the connection pool and contains fields such as maxConns and minIdleConns to specify the maximum and minimum number of connections to maintain respectively. The Opt struct is used to specify options for the connection pool such as the host, port, and idle timeout.

The NewTcpConnPool function initializes the connection pool and creates a number of idle connections based on the minIdleConns field. It also starts two goroutines, handleQueue and release, to handle incoming connection requests and release idle connections respectively.

The Get function is used to retrieve a connection from the pool. If there are idle connections available, it returns one of those. Otherwise, if the maximum number of connections has not been reached, it creates a new connection and returns that. If the maximum number of connections has been reached, it queues the request and waits for an idle connection to become available.

The handleQueue function handles queued connection requests by waiting for an idle connection to become available. If a connection is not available within 3 seconds, it returns an error.

The release function periodically checks for idle connections that have exceeded the idle timeout and removes them from the pool.

Overall, it seems like you have implemented a solid TCP connection pool that can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.
